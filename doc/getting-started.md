# 🚀 Getting Started with BlackThorn

This guide will help you get started with BlackThorn, a modern C++ behavior tree library.

## 📦 Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev sfml-dev
```

## 🔨 Download and Compilation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lecrapouille/Blackthorn --recurse
cd Blackthorn
make download-external-libs
make -j8          # builds library + examples
make test -j8     # optional unit tests
```

## 👁️ Running Oakular (Editor and Visualizer)

BlackThorn comes with **Oakular** - a standalone editor and visualizer application:

```bash
./build/Oakular --port 9090
```

Oakular can work in two modes:
- **Editor mode**: Create and edit behavior trees graphically
- **Visualizer mode**: Display runtime behavior trees from TCP clients

A blank window will appear waiting for a connection with a client application using this library. Launch it before a demo to see live node states.

## 🏃 Running Examples

```bash
make examples -j8
./build/Example-GameState   # doc/examples/GameState
./build/Example-Patrol      # doc/examples/Patrol
```

Each example folder contains its own `Makefile`, YAML description, and C++ entry point. Use them as templates for your own projects.

## ⚡ Quick Example

### 📝 Using YAML (Recommended)

Create a `tree.yaml` file:

```yaml
BehaviorTree:
  Sequence:
    children:
      - Action:
          name: "OpenDoor"
      - Action:
          name: "Walk"
      - Action:
          name: "CloseDoor"
```

Then in your C++ code:

```cpp
#include "BlackThorn/BlackThorn.hpp"
#include "BlackThorn/Builder.hpp"

auto builder = bt::Builder::create();
auto result = builder->loadFromFile("tree.yaml");
if (result.hasError()) {
    std::cerr << "Error: " << result.getError() << std::endl;
    return;
}

auto tree = result.getTree();
tree->tick();  // Execute the tree
```
